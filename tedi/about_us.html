        <h1>About us</h1>
        <p>
           We are a group of students from the School of Technology Electronic Systems. Our names are Teodora, Martin and Georgi. We are 8th grade and we made this site for our project for the end of the year. Our goal is to encourage people to start working out and make their fitness experience easier. With the help of our site you can easily track your fitness progress so you can get in shape. Through the power of modern technology which we are learning at school, we made this functional site which we can maybe develop in the future.
